## Project Overview

This is a custom **WordPress plugin** developed as a shipping task project for **FluentCart** – a modern, lightweight eCommerce plugin for WordPress.

The plugin adds a **Universal Shipping Restriction System** that allows administrators to restrict shipping to specific countries (or the whole world except excluded ones). It provides real-time validation on the checkout page: if a customer selects a restricted country, a clear red warning appears, and the "Place Order" button is disabled.

This is a **custom addon plugin** built on top of the core FluentCart plugin (not an official extension).

## Features

- Easy installation and activation alongside FluentCart
- Dedicated admin menu (**FC Shipping**) with Vue.js-powered clean interface
- Create multiple shipping zones
- Define zone name and apply rules to "Whole World" or specific regions
- Exclude specific countries from shipping
- Enable standard flat-rate shipping per zone
- Real-time country detection on checkout (based on Billing Address)
- Visual red alert message: "We do not ship to this country"
- Automatic disabling of the Place Order button for restricted countries
- Seamless integration with FluentCart's cart and checkout flow

## Installation

1. Ensure **FluentCart** (core plugin) is installed and activated on your WordPress site.
2. Upload the plugin zip file via WordPress Admin → Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin.
3. Activate the "FluentCart Shipping Restriction" plugin.
4. A new menu **FC Shipping** will appear in the admin dashboard.
