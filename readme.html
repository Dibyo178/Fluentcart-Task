Phase 1: Plugin Installation & Activation
Plugin Management: The system starts with the installation of the "FluentCart Shipping Restriction" plugin alongside the core FluentCart plugin in the WordPress dashboard.
Dashboard UI: Once activated, a dedicated FC Shipping menu appears, featuring a clean Vue.js interface for managing shipping zones.
Phase 2: Global Admin Configuration
Shipping Zones: Admins can define specific "Zone Names" (e.g., Main Zone) and decide if the rules apply to the "Whole World" or specific regions.
 Method Setup: Within each zone, you can enable "Standard Shipping" with custom Flat Rate amounts and aggregation rules.
Phase 3: Product & Store Management
Product Creation: Admins can easily add new products, such as an iPhone 14, and categorize them as Physical or Digital.
Publishing Control: Every product has a dedicated management panel to control its status (Draft/Publish) and URL slugs.
Page Setup: The plugin offers a "Create Shop Page" wizard to automatically generate the necessary frontend shortcodes.
Phase 4: Customer Shopping Journey
Cart Interaction: Customers browse the shop, select items like the iPhone 14, and view their subtotal in a modern sliding side-cart.
Proceed to Checkout: From the cart, the "Go to Checkout" button leads the user to the final validation stage.
Phase 5: Real-time Validation & Security
Location Detection: On the checkout page, the system monitors the "Billing Address" country selection in real-time.
Restricted Country Logic: If a user selects a country that was added to the Excluded (e.g., United Kingdom):
Visual Warning: A high-visibility Red Alert appears: " We do not ship to this country".
Action Prevention: The "Place Order" button is automatically disabled to prevent unauthorized transactions.
