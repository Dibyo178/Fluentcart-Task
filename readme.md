## ✨ Core Features

### 🌍 Universal Shipping Restrictions
- **Allowed List:** Restrict shipping only to specific countries (Whitelist).
- **Excluded List:** Block specific countries even if global shipping is enabled (Blacklist).
- **Conflict Management:** Built-in logic to prevent adding the same country to both lists simultaneously.

### 🛠 Dynamic System Modes
- **Global Mode:** Apply shipping rules across all available shipping methods.
- **Per Method Restriction:** Select a specific shipping method from the dropdown to apply rules exclusively to that method.

### ⚡ Real-time Checkout Validation
- **Live Detection:** Monitors the country selection field on the checkout page instantly.
- **Smart Prevention:** Automatically disables the **"Place Order"** button and displays a high-visibility warning message if a restricted country is selected.

### 📊 Order Metadata & Logging
- **Detailed Insights:** Every order captures the country and validation status (Passed/Flagged) in the metadata.
- **Admin Logs:** View the last 10 restriction activities directly from the plugin dashboard to monitor blocked attempts.

2. **Priority:** The system prioritizes the **Excluded** list over the **Allowed** list for maximum security.
3. **Frontend Hook:** A JavaScript observer monitors the checkout form.
4. **Validation:** If the selection violates the rules, the checkout button is locked, and the reason is displayed to the user.
5. **Final Log:** The validation status is recorded in the order metadata upon attempt.
